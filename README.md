# ShipLog (PRE-RELEASE 2)
This plugin lets you see stdio on the vita


//Put together by dots_tb

//Created for Kancolle Kai Vita translation and dev* team (expecially you senpai ~<3)

//Special thanks to Team_Molecule for Taihen (special thanks to xyz), Mai for MaiDump

//thanks to xerpi for being underrated (and logging functions for debugging)

//now that I think of it, I could probably just use printf now...
## To-Do
 * net
 * usb
 * others
 * user plugin
 * exports
## Installation
Add the library to your "*KERNEL" section in the TaiHen config (ux0:/tai/config.txt)

ux0:tai/backdoor.exe.skprx

## Usage
It will create logs at "ux0:/dump/*"

This is because it uses xerpi's code.
### READ ME

AT THE MOMENT THERE IS NO WAY TO FORCE IT OUT OF MEMORY, YOU MUST SPAM THE LOGS (I USUALLY JUST START FTP AND CLOSE IT).

User app will come soon.
